# RANDOM_PASSWORD_GENERATOR

Creating a strong password is a tedious task.  
We can build an website to generate strong passwords randomly that contain alphabets, characters, and digits.  
User can specify the guidelines on no of characters, special characters, numbers, etc to create unpredictable strong passwords.  
The user can also copy the password so that they can directly paste it when creating the website.
